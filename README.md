# handy-google-colab
This repository provides a set of scripts and notebooks which enable access of google colab from a local machine. The main solution was provided in a [forum post](https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/using-pycharm-to-debug-pytorch-model-on-gce-aws-or-azure/46212/4) and in accompanying [repository](https://github.com/wojtekcz/ml_seminars/tree/master/demo_colab_ssh_access) that contains a tutorial notebook on how to do the stuff (in polish). Here I did a restructure and simplification of the code using a set of scripts and the repository itself.
